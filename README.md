# Explainability of neural networks based on their architecture
This github repository works as a platform for my Master's thesis, Explainability of neural networks based on their architecture.
The dataset used in this study is CIFAR-10 dataset from Learning Multiple Layers of Features from Tiny Images, Alex Krizhevsky, 2009.
The code may require some tweaking to actually perform, especially to get the paths down correct. For the most part one can simply go from top to bottom in a sequence once the data is present, and the code blocks will provide some neat steps.
